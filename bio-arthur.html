						<h2>Here's is what I did on this project.</h2>
						<p>I founded this group with the idea of creating a JavaScript game, and I worked on creating the blocks and the collision on the blocks.  I also added mouse control on the paddles and a radio button form to turn mouse control on and off.  At first the group wanted the block placement to be purely random, but then they wanted them spaced out more.  I tried to write code that checks for close blocks, but it never made any visual difference.  It also had missing object errors that occurred randomly.  Two other group members started working on my blocks, so to defend my efforts I was inspired to come up with a different approach that worked immediately: the good old for loop.  Two for loops puts the blocks into a standard grid, and a 50/50 random chance places a block on the grid, or not.  The game became so functional that I realized that the paddles needed mouse control, so I implemented it.</p>

									<p>The game is very impressive so far. Thanks for being willing to be flexible with your original concept. I'm sure you'll create the avalanche game eventually. --

						<h2>Check out other things I have done.</h2>
						<p>In 1991 I wrote my own version of a Tetris game to see how one approach of making that game would work.  I wrote it on Applesoft Basic to prove such a game could have been created years ago.  Late in 2016, in anticipation of going to Code Fellows, I wrote my own version of a Columns game.  I tried writing it in Game Maker, but I ran in to trouble.  So I found an Applesoft Basic emulator and wrote the game in that.  A friend scoffed at the idea that writing a game in such an archaic language would help in learning modern coding, the review of loops and arrays was very helpful for class.  For the final project, I was planning on adapting the Columns code to a game where you are a state highway worker clearing avalanches safely, but the rest of the group thought that idea was too complicated.</p>
