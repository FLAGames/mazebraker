## Pitch

- What is the problem you're solving?
Create a game based on the Atari classic Breakout with a new twist for modern web browsers.
- What will be your solution to the problem?
We will be re structuring the paddles and position of the blocks and taking away the bouncing off the walls aspect from the original.
- What are the benefits to your solution?
This adds a new level of complexity to a familiar classic.
- stretch goals.
1. Add multiple levels
2. Add mouse controls
3. High score list
