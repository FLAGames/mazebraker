# Group Agreement

**How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?**
We will communicate through Slack. We will discuss everyone’s ideas so that everyone’s voice is heard and any concerns addressed.

**Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?**
As a team, we will discuss the conflict and find a solution. Most importantly, we agree to keep communications open.

If we have conflicting ideas, we will take a vote and pick a path to move forward on.

**Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
 In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.**
We will assign tasks to ourselves as a team in lab or through Slack. Each team will communicate when he is done with a task or is having difficulties and needs help resolving.

**Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? (see the git-team-workflow.md)**
- Each teammate will fork our organization's repo and work on a topic branch on any assigned tasks.
- We will create issues/tasks and assign to team members to complete. The team member will move the issue to the "In progress" and work on the issue.
- When complete, the team member will push the topic branch and the team will review the pull request.
- When done merging the issue will be closed.

**Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.**
We will strive to meet every day at lab. Any member that cannot be present will be kept in communication with the team.
